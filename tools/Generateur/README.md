# Very minimalist documentation

## Programs
- Generateur: source code generator working on database defined in etc/_Configuration.ini
- Generateur_Modeles: template editor for Generator for key values produced from other key values, can be modified  in directory Generateur_de_code/01_Listes

## Template Subdirectories
- Generateur_de_code/07_TypeMappings:\
  text files with mappings in function of the original database field type\
  value can be used in Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Membres with key\
    Membre.Mapped_Type_<TypeMappingFilename.txt>

- Generateur_de_code/05_ApplicationTemplate: 
  - templates at the level of the whole application (for example to generate one menu item for each table)
  - keys are replaced by something build with several table names

- Generateur_de_code/03_Template:
  - template at the level of one table.
  - each template is duplicated for each table

- Generateur_de_code/01_Listes
  - key value produced from other key values, can be modified with Generateur_Modeles
    a key value is defined in a specific subdirectory by 5 files:
    - the key with 01_key in the file name
    - the prefix of the value 02_begin for example "(" for list enclosed by parenthesis
    - the definition of the element 03_element . Keywords in this element will be expanded upon production of the value
    - the separator between elements 04_separateur for example "," for list where each elements are separed by a coma.
    - the suffix 05_end for example ")" for list enclosed by parenthesis
  - Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Tables works at the application to produce a key value based on the different table names.
  - The others subdirectories of Generateur_de_code/01_Listes work at the table level to produce a key value based on field names:
    - Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Aggregations for "one to many" relation (current table line relate to many lines in another table)
    - Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Details current table line relate to one line in another table
    - Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Symetric . Related to pascal "uses" units hierarchy, you need the code for the two tables in the same unit. Current table line relate to one line in another table and you need the same access from both sides of the relation.
    - Generateur_de_code/01_Listes/Membres the simple case, to produce a key value based on field names of the table

## Parameters in subdirectory Generateur_de_code/04_Parametres
The name of each txt file starts with the name of the table followed by a dot. and a suffix for the kind of parameter:
-  .Cle.txt\
   list of fields for the key of the table, one per line, in the form :\
     Field_name
- .Aggregations.txt : ("one to many" relations)\
   list of aggregations, one per line, in the form :\
     NameOfAggregation = Table_name_of_elements_of_the_aggregation
- .Details.txt (current table line relate to one line in another table)\
   list of details, one per line, in the form :\
     Field_name = Table_name_of_the_element
- .order_by.txt\
   list of fields for the default "order by" , one per line, in the form :\
     Field_name
- .libelle.txt\
    Field name for the libelle

## Static files in subdirectory Generateur_de_code/02_Application

## Result of code generation in Generateur_de_code/06_Resultat

In most of the cases I use MeldMerge (https://meldmerge.org/)
to update my actual source code directory from Generateur_de_code/06_Resultat
when I've made a change in the input of the code generation, whether it is
in the database, in the templates or the parameters.
