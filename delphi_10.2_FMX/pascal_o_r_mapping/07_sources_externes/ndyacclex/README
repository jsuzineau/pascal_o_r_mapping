    What:
    
    Next Delphi Yacc & Lex is a parser generator toolset for Delphi, based on
    Delphi Yacc & Lex, version 1.4 by Michiel Rook and Turbo Pascal Lex and Yacc,
    version 4.1, by Albert Graef et al.
    
    The primary goal is to clean up the code, and improve compatibility
    and maintainability.
    
    Why:
    
    The project started because the original Delphi Yacc & Lex did not compile well
    in Delphi XE3 and the last release or activity dates back to 2005.
