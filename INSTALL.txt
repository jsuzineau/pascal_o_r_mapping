For now I'm not expert in use of lazarus packages, but usually the following should work.

For Linux use projects and packages ending with "_linux"
For Microsoft Windows use project and packages ending with "_mswindows"

Usually, you should :
- Open Lazarus
- Open and compile in Lazarus:
  OD_DelphiReportEngine_LCL        (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/1_LCL)
  OD_DelphiReportEngine_Units      (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/2_Units)
  OD_DelphiReportEngine_Components (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/4_Components)
  lclextensions_package.lpk        (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/7_sources_externes/lclextensions-0.5.1)
- Open, compile and install (Use/Install) in Lazarus:
  OD_DelphiReportEngine_Controls   (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/5_Controls)
  virtualtreeview_package.lpk      (sub-directory pascal_o_r_mapping/7_sources_externes\virtualtreeview-4.8.7_LCL-R2)

To run jsWorks:
 It uses a mysql database. 
You have a binary copy of sample database in sub directory base_mysql/jsWorks.
Usually you just need to copy this jsWorks directory in your mysql datadir. 
You can find your datadir by issuing the command SHOW VARIABLES; in your MySQL client or PHPMyAdmin.
MySQL client library libmysqlclient.so (linux) or libmysql.dll (windows) needs to be in the PATH.
Connection parameters to MySQL are stored in an etc sub-directory of the directory containing the executable, 
In this case: jsWorks/etc/_Configuration.ini, section [MySQL]
for now Version can be 
     50 for MySQL 5.0 ( TMySQL50Connection)
     51 for MySQL 5.1 ( TMySQL51Connection)
     55 for MySQL 5.5 ( TMySQL55Connection)
The related code is around line 140 in pascal_o_r_mapping/3_Data/uMySQL.pas
For now the code runs mainly with MySQL. 
With some tuning it should be possible to run it with unixODBC/Informix, but I haven't tested a lot for now. 
Some work is done to make it working with Postgres, but not functionnal for now.
(See pascal_o_r_mapping/2_Units/uSGBD.pas, 
     pascal_o_r_mapping/3_Data/uInformix.pas, 
     pascal_o_r_mapping/3_Data/uPostgres.pas,
     pascal_o_r_mapping/3_Data/udmDatabase.pas,
     pascal_o_r_mapping/3_Data/uRequete.pas
     )

Then you should be able to compile and run jsWorks.
jsWorks(_linux/_windows) is a desktop application with a form.
http_jsWorks is a console application implementing a rustic http server. 
The html part use Google Angular.js and json format to communicate with the server.
Run http_jsWorks and point your browser at http://localhost:1500/, 
 you should get a web page with functionalities similar to the desktop application.
